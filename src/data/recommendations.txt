I have worked with Alexey Zerkalenkov over the last year. I have enjoyed collaborating with him on various design and prototyping project for Allplan. His dedication to his work is exceptional to put it mildly.

He is a talented designer, a highly skilled programmer, and a wonderful person to work with. I cannot recommend Alexey enough... Any organization would be very lucky to work with him.
