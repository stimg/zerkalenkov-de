Alexey Zerkalenkov – Senior Fullstack AI Engineer

Location: Remote / Europe | Availability: immediately available for contract engagements in DACH region

20+ years, 14+ enterprise projects, freelancing since 2009.

Tagline: 20+ years turning complex problems into production-grade web platforms and AI solutions – from 3D CAD viewers to voice-enabled GenAI assistants.

About: Twenty years of building software taught me one thing most engineers miss: code that ships fast means nothing if it doesn't solve the right problem. I've replaced entire development teams, delivered industry firsts, and mentored engineers from junior to confident – all while staying the engineer who writes the code, not just talks about it.

My work spans the full modern stack – React, TypeScript, Python, Node.js, AWS cloud infrastructure, and increasingly, GenAI systems with RAG pipelines, LLMs, and agentic AI workflows. At igus GmbH, I reduced main page load time 3x through a single well-targeted middleware optimization. At Samsung, I wrote automation scripts that sped up bug fixing 50x and pushed NL test pass rates from 63% to 98%. At Nemetschek Allplan, I built the industry's first browser-based 3D CAD viewer – alone – which contributed to a ~5% stock value increase. These aren't flukes. They're what happens when deep technical knowledge meets genuine ownership of outcomes.

What drives me isn't the technology itself – it's the moment a complex system finally clicks into place and makes someone's work measurably better. Whether that's a product consultant getting answers in real time from a voice AI assistant, or a junior engineer writing their first clean, testable module, I care about the outcome, not just the output. Available immediately for contract engagements in the DACH region.
